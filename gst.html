              <dd>
                <p> GST, or Goods and Services Tax, is a consumption tax levied on the
                  supply of goods and services. This multi-stage tax is designed to
                  eliminate cascading effects and create a more efficient taxation
                  system. At Garnet Professional Pvt Ltd, we adhere to the GST
                  regulations to contribute to a transparent and accountable business
                  environment.</p>

                  GST throughout the supply chain, ultimately benefiting our
